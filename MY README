1. Logging in as SYSDBA
To manage databases, you need to log in as SYSDBA. You do this from the command prompt by typing sqlplus / as sysdba.

2. Checking Existing PDBs
After logging in, check which Pluggable Databases (PDBs) exist by typing: SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$pdbs;. This will show you the available PDBs and whether they are open or closed.

3. Opening a PDB
If your PDB is closed or in read-only mode, you need to open it for use. Do this by typing ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_name OPEN;, where pdb_name is the name of your PDB.

To automatically open the PDB in the future, type ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_name SAVE STATE;.

4. Creating a User and Password
If you haven't created a user, use the command CREATE USER myuser IDENTIFIED BY mypassword;. After that, grant access rights with GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO myuser;.

5. Connecting to the PDB as a User
After creating the user, you can log in as the user. First, exit the SYSDBA session by typing exit. Then, connect to the PDB using your username and password: sqlplus username/password@pdb_name.

For example: sqlplus myuser/mypassword@ORCLPDB1.

6. Verifying the Connection
To make sure you're connected to the right PDB, type SELECT name FROM v$database; after logging in. This will show you the name of the database you are working in.

7. Common Issues and Solutions
If you see an error about not being able to connect (like "TNS could not resolve"), check the connection details (PDB name, listener, and port).
If the database isnâ€™t open, use the command ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_name OPEN; to open it.
8. Closing a PDB
When done, you can close the PDB by typing ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb_name CLOSE;.
